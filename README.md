A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc.
Have links to your hosted and working apps in the README.md files in your GitHub repos.

technologies used:
Javascipt 
HTML
CSS
REACT
Reactstrap
Mongo Database
Heroku

approach taken:
Create a site for service technician to communicate with the frontdesk on which vehicles repairs are finished 

unsolved problems:
Would like to add more edit functionality, and be able to add a descriptions category where the issues with the vehicle would be listed.
We'd also like to add picture of problems or specific damage to vehicle if that would be helpful to technician.

user stories:
? 

any notes to yourself:
Merge issues aren't fun. 
In the future make sure teammates are all working on completely different sections of code.
